# Buidling Administration App
This application is a simple apartment building administration app that can be used by both the administrator and the residents of the building.

# How it works?
1. The first window is the Login Window. Each user has a username and a password.
   - For admin: Username - admin, Password - admin
   - For residents: Username - user, Password - user
2. The Admin window contains:
   - A list of all the residents with details about each of them
   - A form to add new residents
   - A page to centralize messages from residents
3. The User page contains:
   - A form used to write messages seen only by the Admin
